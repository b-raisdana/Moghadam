# Steps of The Strategy

1. Detect levels, their effective timeframe, boundary, and their strength
2. Detect Rally/Base/Drop periods
- sequence of 2 pairs of falling/rising peaks and valleys = Rally/Drop
- sequential movement of 3 ATR is a rally/trend. is always covered by tops rally/drops?
- \>3 sequential (spinning candles + gap \< spinning) = Base.(jozve-amin-hemmati-220-(KohanFx.com).pdf) .if \<3 it is a minor base. expand previous rally/drop range to cover minor bases and merge with next if it is from the same kind.
- Base = dogi (\<30% body + <Standard) between two rally/drop = Bullish/Bearish movement faster than ATR and sequential candles shall have big (>70) body.
- Base zone with one candle is stronger than 2 candle ones.
- \>3 standard or smaller candles >80% overlaps with previous one = Base

4. Detect Pivots and create Levels
   a. after a confirmed trend reversal, expect to move 3 ATR toward trend + 1ATR reverse

7. Detect Level reactions and Gap reactions
8. Set stop loss and Target Profit and decide to trade or not.
9. Put the order, Update SL according to price updates
10. Do risk-free and manage position according to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd TPs
11. of failed in 8 (>7) sequential trades shutdown for administrative inspection



  test:
  peaks or valleys should not be included in peaks or valleys of major timeframes
  every boudary should include at least 2 peaks and 2 valleys???
